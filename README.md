# CIS310Project

This was a semester-long project using window forms with C#. Data is added/updated/deleted from an SQL database using Linq with C#. This isn't 100% complete (about 85%-90%) because of the time constraint. Issues are: the cart system and the discount for the invoice.

Project discription:
This is a program created for a music instructor's studio. The instructor (administrator) has a seperate login screen from students (general user) and responsible parties (i.e. - parent responsible for the for the student's purchases/lessons). The instructor can add/update/delete students, products, lessons, and responsible parties. The student can add lessons, purchase products, view invoice, and edit personal information.
